# Verification database — schema reference

## Technology choice

SQLite. Chosen because the verification service runs on a single dedicated lab machine with no need for concurrent multi-user access, network availability, or a separate database server. The entire database is a single file. See [ADR-006](adr/ADR-006-sqlite.md).

The schema DDL lives at: `schema/verification_schema.sql`

## Design principles

**Records are immutable snapshots.** Once a run is written, it is never modified. `expected_value` and `full_expected_metrics` in `sample_results` are denormalised from the gold standard and frozen at the time of the run — they are never backfilled if the gold standard is later updated.

**Gold standard versions are never deleted.** When a gold standard is updated, the old version is retired by setting `superseded_at`. The full history of what was expected at every point in time is always intact.

**The release is a lens, not a load-bearing wall.** `gold_standard_releases` and `release_entries` are convenience tables only. Nothing in the verification logic depends on them. They exist to answer "what were the active standards on date X?" See [ADR-008](adr/ADR-008-gold-standard-versioning.md).

## Table reference

### `gold_standard_exp_versions`
One row per registered version of a gold standard experiment. The `superseded_at` field is null for the currently active version of each experiment.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `gs_exp_version_id` | TEXT PK | Surrogate UUID |
| `experiment_id` | TEXT | Natural id e.g. `"EXP_LT_control_assay"`. Repeats across versions — this is expected and correct. |
| `version_number` | INTEGER | Per-experiment counter. Increments on each update. |
| `checksum_hash` | TEXT | SHA-256 of the gold standard CSV at registration time. |
| `file_path` | TEXT | Local path to the CSV at registration time. |
| `registered_at` | TEXT | ISO-8601 timestamp. |
| `registered_by` | TEXT | Name of registering person. |
| `reason` | TEXT | Human-readable reason for this version e.g. `"algo improvement v2.4"`. |
| `superseded_at` | TEXT | NULL if currently active. ISO-8601 timestamp when retired. |

---

### `gold_standard_samples`
One row per sample per gold standard experiment version. This is where the actual expected values live.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `gs_sample_id` | TEXT PK | Surrogate UUID |
| `gs_exp_version_id` | TEXT FK | References `gold_standard_exp_versions` |
| `sample_id` | TEXT | Natural sample id e.g. `"2DU008_01"`. Repeats across versions. |
| `primary_metric` | TEXT | *(MVP scaffolding)* Name of the metric being compared e.g. `"count"`. Provides a simple single-value path through the pipeline so all machinery can be built before the JSON comparison design is finalised. |
| `primary_metric_value` | REAL | *(MVP scaffolding)* The gold standard value for the primary metric. |
| `full_metrics` | TEXT | JSON blob containing all metric columns from the gold standard CSV. |
| `notes` | TEXT | Optional annotation. |

---

### `gold_standard_releases`
Optional. A named snapshot of which experiment versions were active at a point in time.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `release_id` | TEXT PK | Surrogate UUID |
| `release_number` | INTEGER | Auto-incrementing human reference number. |
| `created_at` | TEXT | ISO-8601 timestamp. |
| `created_by` | TEXT | |
| `notes` | TEXT | e.g. `"post algo-v2.4 gold standard update"` |

---

### `release_entries`
Join table linking a release to the experiment versions it captured.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `release_id` | TEXT FK | References `gold_standard_releases` |
| `gs_exp_version_id` | TEXT FK | References `gold_standard_exp_versions` |

---

### `runs`
One row per test harness execution.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `run_id` | TEXT PK | Matches the `run_id` in the manifest filename. |
| `triggered_at` | TEXT | ISO-8601 timestamp. |
| `pipeline_build` | TEXT | e.g. `"IAP-v2.4.1"` |
| `scenario` | TEXT | e.g. `"full_regression_suite"` |
| `manifest_path` | TEXT | Path to the manifest JSON that governed this run. |
| `verdict` | TEXT | `"pass"` \| `"fail"` \| `"warn"` \| `"aborted"` |

---

### `experiment_results`
One row per experiment per run.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `result_id` | TEXT PK | Surrogate UUID |
| `run_id` | TEXT FK | References `runs` |
| `gs_exp_version_id` | TEXT FK | The exact gold standard version this experiment was verified against. |
| `experiment_id` | TEXT | Denormalised for convenient querying. |
| `feature_set` | TEXT | Denormalised for convenient querying. |
| `classification` | TEXT | `"stability"` \| `"exploratory"` |
| `pre_verify_status` | TEXT | `"pass"` \| `"checksum_fail"` \| `"subset_fail"` |
| `verdict` | TEXT | `"pass"` \| `"fail"` \| `"warn"` \| `"aborted"` |
| `verified_at` | TEXT | ISO-8601 timestamp. |

---

### `sample_results`
One row per sample per experiment result.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `sample_result_id` | TEXT PK | Surrogate UUID |
| `result_id` | TEXT FK | References `experiment_results` |
| `gs_sample_id` | TEXT FK | The exact gold standard sample this was compared against. |
| `sample_id` | TEXT | Denormalised for convenient querying. |
| `primary_metric` | TEXT | *(MVP scaffolding)* Name of the metric compared. Mirrors `gold_standard_samples.primary_metric`. |
| `actual_value` | REAL | *(MVP scaffolding)* The pipeline output value for the primary metric. |
| `expected_value` | REAL | *(MVP scaffolding)* Snapshot of the primary metric gold standard value at time of run. Never backfilled. |
| `deviation_percent` | REAL | *(MVP scaffolding)* `abs(actual - expected) / expected * 100` |
| `full_actual_metrics` | TEXT | JSON blob of all actual metric values produced by the pipeline for this sample. |
| `full_expected_metrics` | TEXT | JSON blob snapshot of all gold standard metric values at time of run. Never backfilled. |
| `verdict` | TEXT | `"pass"` \| `"fail"` |

---

### `reports`
LLM-generated narrative reports. `result_id` is nullable — a null value indicates a run-level summary report rather than a per-experiment report.

| Column | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `report_id` | TEXT PK | Surrogate UUID |
| `run_id` | TEXT FK | References `runs` |
| `result_id` | TEXT FK (nullable) | References `experiment_results`. NULL = run-level report. |
| `llm_narrative` | TEXT | Full narrative text from the LLM analysis module. |
| `overall_verdict` | TEXT | `"pass"` \| `"fail"` \| `"warn"` |
| `generated_at` | TEXT | ISO-8601 timestamp. |

## Key queries

**Current active gold standard for an experiment:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM gold_standard_exp_versions

  AND gsv.version_number = 1
ORDER BY r.triggered_at ASC;
```

**All experiments updated in a given release:**
```sql
SELECT gsv.experiment_id, gsv.version_number, gsv.reason

WHERE re.release_id = '<release_id>';
```

**All failed stability experiments across the last 10 runs:**
```sql
SELECT r.run_id, r.pipeline_build, er.experiment_id, er.verdict
FROM experiment_results er
JOIN runs r ON er.run_id = r.run_id
WHERE er.classification = 'stability'
  AND er.verdict = 'fail'
ORDER BY r.triggered_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
