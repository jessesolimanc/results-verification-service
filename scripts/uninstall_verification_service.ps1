<#
.SYNOPSIS
  Stops and removes the results-verification-service Windows Service
  (see install_verification_service.ps1 / ADR-024).

  Does NOT touch the repo, the venv, the database, or any manifests/
  reports — only the NSSM-registered service entry itself.

.DESCRIPTION
  Checks nssm's exit code after both stop and remove and aborts before
  claiming success if either fails — PowerShell's $ErrorActionPreference
  does not turn a native command's nonzero exit code into a terminating
  error on its own, so without this a failed `nssm stop` would not have
  stopped a failed `nssm remove` from being attempted, and a failed
  `nssm remove` would not have stopped this script from printing "Done"
  with the service still registered (PR review, session 15).
