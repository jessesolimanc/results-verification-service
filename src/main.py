    also cancels manifest_watch_task directly and, since Python 3.9,
    calls loop.shutdown_default_executor() before returning — which waits
    for any verify_run() currently in flight on its worker thread
    (asyncio.to_thread) to actually finish, rather than killing it

    documented asyncio.run() shutdown sequence, not something this

        Startup self-healing (ADR-024 addendum, sessions 16-17).

        A manifest can end up sitting unarchived at the top of
        manifests_dir even though its run_id is already in
        processed_run_ids — i.e. verify_run() already committed its
        runs/experiment_results/sample_results transaction. The main way
        this happens: a stop signal (Ctrl+C, or NSSM's equivalent on a
        service stop) arrives while on_confirmed() is awaiting
        asyncio.to_thread(verify_run, ...). asyncio.run()'s shutdown
        still lets that worker thread finish — so the DB write
        completes — but the cancellation unwinds past on_confirmed()'s
        try/except/else entirely (CancelledError is a BaseException, not
        an Exception, so it isn't caught there), and the follow-up
        _archive(run_id, processed_dir) call never runs.

        Left alone this is permanent: nothing ever revisits an already-
        registered manifest, and stamp_manifest_for_run.py's safety check
        refuses every future dispatch because of it, even though the run
        it's complaining about is actually done. Reconciling here, before
        anything is registered as "expected," fixes this on the very next
        restart — including recovering from causes other than a clean
        Ctrl+C, e.g. the process being killed outright.

        A run row alone isn't proof the run is fully done, though:
        verify_run() commits runs/experiment_results/sample_results in
        one transaction and only afterward calls write_report(), which
        writes the CSVs and inserts into reports as a separate,
        later transaction. A hard kill in that gap leaves a runs row
        with no report. Archiving a manifest on the strength of the
        runs row alone would permanently hide that half-finished state,
        so this function requires both processed_run_ids (from runs)
        and reported_run_ids (from reports) before it will archive —
        a run_id in the former but not the latter is left unarchived
        and flagged for a human to investigate instead.

        Uses the same context_manifest_*.json glob as manifest_watcher.py
        (not narrowed to *_run_* names) so this catches exactly the set
        of files the live watcher would otherwise pick up. Any manifest
        that fails to parse or is missing/malformed structure (bad JSON,
        an unreadable file, or a shape that doesn't match what's
        expected, e.g. {"run": null}) is skipped rather than raised —
        one broken file must never prevent the service from starting.
