gate.py — pre-verification integrity checks.

Two sequential checks before any results comparison:
  1. Checksum check — gold standard file matches registered hash
  2. Subset check  — all samples in workbook exist in parent
                     gold standard (child experiments only)

If either check fails the run is aborted and no comparison runs.
