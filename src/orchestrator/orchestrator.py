orchestrator.py — coordinates the full verification flow for a run.

For each run detected by the listener:
  1. Load the run context manifest
  2. For each experiment in the manifest:
     a. Run the pre-verification gate
     b. Locate the result folder and CSV
     c. Run per-sample comparison (if gate passes)
  3. Determine experiment and run verdicts
  4. Persist results to the database
  5. Write CSV reports and store JSON blob

    Full verification flow for a single run.

    Opens its own DB connection so it is safe to call from a worker
    thread (e.g. via asyncio.to_thread) without hitting SQLite's
    check_same_thread restriction.

    experiment_names maps experiment_id -> the pipeline's own timestamped
    name for that execution (from the notification's "name" field),
    collected live as notifications arrive — the manifest itself has no
    way to know this ahead of time.

    manifest_record_path is the path to store in runs.manifest_path. The
    caller (main.py) is responsible for passing the manifest's *eventual*
    location, not its current one: this function is only invoked once all
    of a run's experiments are confirmed ready, immediately before the
    caller archives the manifest into processed/, so the caller passes
    the destination path it is about to move the file to. Recomputing the
    path from manifests_dir + run_id here would record a location that
    stops existing the moment archiving happens.

    Coordinates gate, comparator, and reporter modules. All results are
    written to the verification database and CSV reports are written to
